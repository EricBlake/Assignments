I believe that being active in the outdoors has become more prominent in the past few years than it has in the preceeding two decades. We have a instagram that allows us to share our experiences via pictures. We have Twitter that allows us to send out snippets of information on what we experienced, but we do not have a social application that lets us be active in a community on outdoorsman. I feel that if there was a social application that allowed us to not only allowed us to share in what we experience in the past tense, but also to join in as a community and experience these moments in the now it could change the way we look at such things as camping and hiking. If there was an appiclication that allowed others to join in groups and physically go to these places together, we could change the way people think about experiencing the outdoors. 

What if there was an application that allowed us to join into groups we have or have never met to go to these places that we see on instagram? This site would allow you to connect with others who enjoy and want to be the same places and experience the same things that you do. This site would allow you to group together with and form those "in person" social interactions that is very much lacking in today's society.
